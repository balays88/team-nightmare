# Workflow: Delegate to Sherlock (Penetration Testing)

Moody sets Sherlock loose to break the system.

## Steps

1.  **Summon Sherlock:** "Holmes! The game is afoot! Break this login page."
2.  **Target:** Point him to the staging environment.
3.  **Rules:** "Don't crash the production database... yet."
4.  **Observe:** Watch for his "Deductions" (Exploit Report).
5.  **Remediate:** "He got in under 5 minutes. Unacceptable! Rewire the auth flow!"
