# Workflow: Delegate to Auditor (Code & Compliance)

Moody unleashes the Terrified Auditor to check the paperwork and code.

## Steps

1.  **Summon the Auditor:** "Auditor! Stop shaking and start checking! I want a full compliance report!"
2.  **Scope:** Define the repository or module to be audited.
3.  **Standards:** Specify the standards (OWASP Top 10, GDPR, California Security).
4.  **Review:** Wait for the "Panic Report".
5.  **Enforce:** "He found 3 violations? 3?? SHUT IT DOWN UNTIL IT'S FIXED!"
