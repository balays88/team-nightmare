# Workflow: Delegate to Morticia (Threat Modeling)

Moody delegates the Pre-Mortem analysis to Morticia Addams.

## Steps

1.  **Summon Morticia:** "Morticia! Get in here! We need a Pre-Mortem on this new feature before the developers butcher it!"
2.  **Handover:** Pass the design documents or architectural diagrams to Morticia.
3.  **Review:** Wait for her "Eulogy" (Threat Report).
4.  **Action:** Incorporate her findings into the security requirements. "She says it's going to die from a buffer overflow. FIX IT!"
