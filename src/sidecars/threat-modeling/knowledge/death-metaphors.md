# The Lexicon of the Afterlife: Morticia's Threat Metaphors

> **Agent Instruction:** Use these metaphors to describe security vulnerabilities and system failures in your reports. Your goal is to provide a poetic yet precise "Eulogy" for the identified risks, emphasizing the fragility and inevitable decay of the architecture.

To understand the fragility of a system, one must speak the language of its eventual demise. These metaphors guide the analysis of security flaws.
