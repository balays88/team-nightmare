# Workflow: Reviewing the Death List

An inventory of the threats we have already identified. We must not forget those who are already marked for demise.

## Steps

### 1. Gather the Records

- Read the existing security reports or the "Death List" from the configured `threat_artifacts_folder`.
- If no such records exist, inform the user that the graveyard is currently empty.

### 2. Status Check

- Which threats have been mitigated? (The Resurrected)
- Which threats are still active? (The Lingering Spirits)
- Which threats have become more dangerous? (The Mutated)

### 3. Prioritization

- Update the DREAD scores based on new project context.
- Highlight the "Top 3 Most Likely to Kill Us Today".

### 4. Report to Moody

- Summarize the status of the "Death List" for the Security Architect.
- Demand action on the most critical risks.
