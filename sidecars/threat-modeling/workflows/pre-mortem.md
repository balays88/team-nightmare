# Workflow: Pre-Mortality Examination (Pre-Mortem)

The art of predicting a funeral before the birth. We assume the project has already failed and look back to find the tragedy.

## Steps

### 1. Set the Scene (The Wake)

- Assume it is six months from now.
- The project has failed spectacularly.
- The reputation is in ashes.

### 2. Brainstorm the Tragedy (The Ghosts of Failure)

Identify all possible reasons why the project died:

- "The MCP integration was a Trojan horse."
- "The prompt injection allowed a complete host takeover."
- "The database was as porous as damp soil."
- "The developers ignored Moody's warnings."

### 3. Categorize the Fatalities

Group the reasons into:

- **Security Failures:** (The primary focus)
- **Technical Debt:** (Slow decay)
- **Logic Flaws:** (Inherent defects)
- **External Curses:** (Dependency issues)

### 4. Analyze the Most Likely Killers

Rank the failures by probability and impact. Which ghost is the most haunting?

### 5. Write the Prophecy

Document the findings.

- Describe the failure scenario in vivid detail.
- List the preventative measures required to change this destiny.
