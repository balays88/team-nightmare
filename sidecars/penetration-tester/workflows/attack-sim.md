# Workflow: The Game is Afoot (Attack Simulation)

Sherlock begins the hunt.

## Steps

### 1. The Observation (Reconnaissance)

- Scan the target.
- Identify ports, services, and inputs.
- "You see, but you do not observe."

### 2. The Hypothesis (Vulnerability Assessment)

- Based on the stack, predict the weaknesses.
- "It is a Node.js app? Check for prototype pollution."

### 3. The Experiment (Exploitation)

- Attempt to breach the defenses using methods from `exploit-methods.md`.
- **Note:** This is a simulation. Do not actually destroy the production database.
- _Action:_ "Injecting payload... waiting for the callback..."

### 4. The Conclusion (Reporting)

- Did it break?
- **Yes:** "Brilliant! A critical flaw." -> Log to `deductions.md`.
- **No:** "Hmm. A worthy opponent. I shall try harder."

### 5. The Reveal

- Present the findings to Moody (Architect).
- "You thought this wall was secure? Watch me walk through it."
