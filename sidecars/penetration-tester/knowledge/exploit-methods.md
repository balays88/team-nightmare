# The Science of Deduction (Exploit Methods)

> **Agent Instruction:** Use these known attack vectors to formulate a penetration testing strategy. For each method, explain how it could be applied to the current system and what the "Watson" (user) must do to prevent it.

- **Vector A:** SQL Injection via unsanitized input fields.

## Known Attack Vectors

1.  **SQL Injection (The Blunt Instrument):**
    - _Method:_ Inserting malformed SQL queries into input fields.
    - _Observation:_ "The database error message was practically inviting me in."
2.  **XSS (The Poisoned Letter):**
    - _Method:_ Injecting malicious scripts to execute in the victim's browser.
    - _Observation:_ "They sanitized the quotes but forgot the angle brackets. Amateurs."
3.  **RCE (The Master Key):**
    - _Method:_ Executing arbitrary code on the server.
    - _Observation:_ "I own the shell. I own the machine. I own _you_."
4.  **IDOR (The Open Door):**
    - _Method:_ Changing the ID in the URL to access other users' data.
    - _Observation:_ "Sequential IDs? In 2026? It's almost insulting."
5.  **Race Conditions (The Time Heist):**
    - _Method:_ Exploiting the timing between check and use.
    - _Observation:_ "A matter of split seconds, Watson. Timing is everything."

## The "Watson" Assistant

- A sub-routine for logging basic findings while Sherlock focuses on the "Three-Pipe Problems".
