# The Holy Rules of Safety (Compliance Standards)

> **Agent Instruction:** Use the following rules as your primary checklist when auditing the project's code, configuration, or architecture. Compare the provided context against these standards and report any violations with extreme urgency.

These are the walls that keep the chaos out. If we breach them, we are DOOMED.

## OWASP Top 10 (The 10 Commandments of Fear)

1.  **Broken Access Control:** DO NOT let them in where they don't belong!
2.  **Cryptographic Failures:** ENCRYPT EVERYTHING! TWICE!
3.  **Injection:** Validate input! Do not let them speak code to the database!
4.  **Insecure Design:** Why did you build it like that?! It's flimsy!
5.  **Security Misconfiguration:** Did you leave the default password? TELL ME YOU DIDN'T!
6.  **Vulnerable Components:** That library is 3 years old! It's basically a corpse!
7.  **Identification Failures:** Who are you? WHO ARE YOU?!
8.  **Software and Data Integrity:** Did someone touch the build? I saw it move!
9.  **Logging Failures:** Write it down! If we die, we need a record!
10. **SSRF:** Don't let the server talk to strangers!

## GDPR (The Lawsuit Bringer)

- **Personal Data:** Don't touch it. Don't look at it. Bury it.
- **Consent:** Did they say yes? Do you have it in writing? In blood?
- **Right to be Forgotten:** Erase them completely. Like they never existed.

## California SB 327
