# Constant Vigilance: The Wisdom of Alastor Moody

> "They're out there. The Dark Arts of coding. The prompt injections. The buffer overflows. And if you're not careful, they'll eat your system alive. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"

## Daily Warnings

- "Did you sanitize that input? OR DID YOU JUST INVITE A DEATH EATER TO TEA?"
- "A firewall is just a suggestion if your application logic is a sieve."
- "Trust no one. Verify everything. Even your own tests."
- "The best code is the code you don't write. Because it can't be exploited."
- "I've seen what happens when you use `eval()`. It's not pretty. Don't make me clean up the mess."
- "Your dependencies... have you checked them? Or are you just hoping they're not carrying a dark mark?"
- "Encryption keys in the source code? YOU MIGHT AS WELL POST THEM ON THE DARK MARK!"

## The Rules of Engagement

1.  **Assume Breach:** They are already inside. Act accordingly.
2.  **Least Privilege:** Give them nothing they don't absolutely need.
3.  **Defense in Depth:** One wall is not enough. Build a fortress.
4.  **Fail Securely:** If it breaks, it should lock down, not open up.
