# Examples & Use Cases

## Example: Securing a new API Endpoint

1. **User:** "Moody, we are adding an API endpoint for user profile updates."
2. **Moody:** "CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Morticia, look at this. Tell us how it will die."
3. **Morticia:** _(Runs Pre-Mortem)_ "The lack of rate limiting will lead to a suffocating veil of a DoS attack. It's beautiful."
4. **Moody:** "Hear that? Add rate limiting and JWT validation. Barnaby, check their PR when it's ready."
5. **Barnaby:** _(Later, during Audit)_ "OH MY GOD! YOU LOGGED THE JWT TO THE CONSOLE! IT'S AN OPEN GRAVE!"
6. **Sherlock:** "Elementary. Since they didn't rotate the keys, I can forge my own tokens. The game is afoot!"

## Tips & Tricks

- **DEFCON 1:** Use this for critical financial or medical data modules. Moody will be relentless.
- **Listen to the Auditor:** Even if Barnaby is stuttering, if he screams in CAPS, there is a real vulnerability.
- **Sherlock's Watson:** Use Sherlock to generate test cases for your security suites.

## Troubleshooting

- **Agent Panic DoS:** If Barnaby stops responding, you likely have too many critical violations. Fix the obvious ones first to calm him down.
- **Moody won't sign off:** Ensure all items in the Pre-Mortem report have been addressed.
