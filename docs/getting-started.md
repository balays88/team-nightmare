# Getting Started with Security Suite

Welcome to the Nightmare Team. This module is designed to protect your project from external threats and internal incompetence.

---

## What This Module Does

It provides a multi-agent team that analyzes your architecture, audits your code, and attacks your implementation to ensure maximum resilience.

---

## Installation

```bash
bmad install security
```

During installation, you will be asked to set a **DEFCON level**.

- Level 5 is for normal development.
- Level 1 is for critical security-first projects where Moody will be exceptionally loud.

---

## First Steps

1. **Summon Morticia** for a Pre-Mortem analysis of your design doc.
2. **Consult Moody** for the secure architecture blueprint.
3. **Ask Barnaby** to scan your `package.json` for vulnerable dependencies.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Design Review:** Use the Pre-Mortem workflow before coding starts.
- **PR Audit:** Run the Compliance Audit on every pull request.
- **Security Spike:** Set Sherlock loose on a specific endpoint to find logic flaws.

## Need Help?

If you run into issues, remember Moody's first rule: **Trust nothing, verify everything.**
Check your `threat_artifacts_folder` for the detailed logs.
